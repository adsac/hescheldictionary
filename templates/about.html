{% block head %} About the Dictionary {% endblock %}

{% block body %} <p class="text-justify">Rabbi Dr. Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972) was born in Poland, studied in Germany, and in 1940 arrived in the United States, where
  he rose to prominence as a leading Jewish philosopher, religious leader, and civil rights activist. Heschel's prolific and poetic philosophical and religious
  writings are well known and read widely. Less well known is a small dictionary that he produced for his students during his first years in North America.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">In the early 1940s, Heschel was a faculty member at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, the central academic institution of Reform Judaism,
  where he taught Jewish philosophy. There, in 1941, he put together and mimeographed a <b>Concise Dictionary of Hebrew Philosophical Terms</b> -
  a Hebrew-English lexicon containing Hebrew philosophical terms commonly found in works of Jewish philosophy, alongside their
  English meanings.</P>

  <p class="text-justify">The dictionary, as Heschel wrote in its preface, was "designed primarily for the use of the students of the Hebrew Unlon College,
    and its scope is entirely pedagogical. It offers the meanings of words in philosophical usage and disregards as far as is possible [...]
    their meaning in other spheres of language." Heschel notes that he did not create the dictionary
    from scratch - he drew from larger works by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thesaurus-philosophicus-linguae-Hebraicae-recentioris/dp/3487306034">Klatzkin</a>,
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophical-Nebukim-Columbia-University-Oriental/dp/0404505120/">Efros</a>, and others. And yet, the dictionary he
    produced serves a unique purpose: providing English-speaking students with an accessible Hebrew philosophical lexicon of manageable size and scope.
   </p>

   <p class="text-justify">
     The dictionary was never published. It has been <a href="https://archive.org/details/AConciseDictionaryOfHebrewPhilosophicalTerms">available
       online</a> for some years in a scanned version of the typewritten booklet Heschel provided his students.
       The present website is an attempt to make this resource accessible and useful, once again, to students of Jewish philosophy. It offers the entire
       contents of Heschel's original dictionary with a simple, quick, intuitive search interface. Like the original, it is intended for students
       and study groups. Scholars looking for more in-depth, specialised information about specific philosophical or scientific terms might
       wish to utilise <a href="https://peshat.gwiss.uni-hamburg.de/">other excellent online resources</a>. My hope is that, in some way, this site will continue to realise Heschel's
       goal in creating his dictionary in the 1940s: making the Jewish philosophical tradition more accessible to dedicated learners, by helping them
       make sense of philosophical texts in Hebrew.
